# ContactForm

This project was a response to a coding challenge for a back-end developer position with the following requirements:

> Build a website contact form. Access to the form should be protected via a login screen. The form
> should contain fields for Name, Email and message at a minimum. Upon submit, the form should send
> the message to the email provided in the form, with the name as the email subject and store the message
> in a database. Stored messages should be viewable via a link on the form screen.

The form is hosted by Amazon Web Services and incorporates SendGrid's e-mail sending services.
